# WatchTower

**Self-hosted uptime monitoring for developers, homelabbers, and small teams.**

WatchTower makes real HTTP(S), TCP, and ICMP checks on configurable intervals, stores the results in SQLite, and pushes every result to the browser the instant it lands via Server-Sent Events. No polling, no page refreshes. When something goes down you know immediately - and when it comes back up, you know that too.

Run it on a Raspberry Pi, a home server, or a cheap VPS. It tracks public-facing APIs and websites just as well as internal services like a Plex server, a NAS, a database port, or a self-hosted app behind a reverse proxy.

## Features

### Monitoring
- **Four check types** - HTTP(S) with full timing breakdown, API with response/body validation, TCP port reachability, ICMP ping
- **Live dashboard** - cards update in real time via Server-Sent Events
- **Time-based history** - view 1h (raw), 12h, 1d, or 1w of history; sparklines and uptime % always match the selected window
- **Detailed HTTP timing** - DNS, TCP, TLS, and TTFB measured and displayed separately
- **SSL certificate monitoring** - days until expiry shown on every HTTPS monitor
- **Summary bar** - total monitors, online/offline count, and average ping at a glance
- **Network Reference strip** - configurable set of external monitors (HTTP endpoints and DNS/ICMP targets) that appear below your main monitors so you can tell at a glance whether an outage is yours or a broader internet issue; never trigger alerts

### Organization
- **Tags** - freeform labels with autocomplete; filter the grid by one or more tags (OR logic)
- **Sorting** - by uptime (worst first), average ping (slowest first), or drag-to-reorder in default mode
- **Drag-to-reorder** - grab any card header and drag to rearrange; order persists across sessions
- **Resizable cards** - toggle any card between 1-column and 2-column width; persists across sessions
- **Compact reference cards** - reference monitors render in a smaller footprint so they don't crowd your real monitors

### Alerts
- **In-app alert panel** - bell icon surfaces active outages with a live elapsed-time counter; resolved alerts show total downtime; dismiss individually or all at once
- **Three alert levels** - Outage, Degraded (configurable ping threshold), and Recovered; each with independent panel visibility and notification frequency (once / every 15 min)
- **HTTP body validation** - optional plain-string check on the response body; treats a mismatch as DOWN even on a 2xx response
- **Telegram** - free push notifications via Telegram Bot API
- **Email** - SMTP delivery; works with Gmail App Passwords, Resend, or any relay; one-click provider presets for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, and iCloud
- **SMS** - Twilio integration (~$0.008/message)
- **Test before saving** - send a test alert with your current form values without committing to save

### Reports
- **Scheduled email reports** - periodic status summaries sent via email on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule
- **Rich HTML email** - dark header with aggregate stats (avg uptime, up/down count, monitor total) followed by a per-monitor table showing status, uptime %, average ping, incident count, and total checks
- **Tag filtering** - optionally restrict a report to monitors with a specific tag; blank sends all monitors
- **Configurable send time** - reports fire at any HH:MM in server local time; the scheduler checks every 60 seconds
- **Test button** - send an immediate 24-hour preview report without waiting for the schedule
- **Email client compatibility** - inline styles, `bgcolor` HTML attributes for Outlook 2007–2019, and `color-scheme: light` meta to prevent dark-mode inversion in Gmail and Apple Mail

### Settings
- **Tabbed settings panel** - centered modal with General, Notifications, Reports, Network, and Modules tabs
- **General tab** - dashboard-wide preferences (chart Y-axis scale, theme)
- **Filtered channels** - per-monitor alert picker only shows channels enabled in Settings; incomplete credentials block save with an error
- **Reports tab** - schedule configuration, tag filter, last-sent timestamp, and test send button; save is blocked if SMTP is not yet configured
- **Network tab** - manage network reference monitors; toggle any of 14 preset endpoints on/off (8 HTTP, 6 DNS/ICMP) and add unlimited custom entries; changes sync immediately on save

### Embed
- **Per-monitor widget** - 360x230 iframe showing a single card with live updates
- **Full dashboard** - read-only iframe view of the entire dashboard; no edit, delete, or settings controls

### Other
- **Dark / Light theme** - toggle in the header; persists in localStorage
- **Persistent storage** - monitors, check history, and alert credentials all survive restarts (SQLite)
- **Docker Compose** - single service, named volume, ships ready to run

## Screenshots

### HTTP Performance Breakdown

Hover any sparkline bar to see the full HTTP timing breakdown - DNS, TCP, TLS, and TTFB rendered as proportional colored segments with millisecond labels. Aggregated windows (12h, 1d, 1w) show average ping and per-bucket uptime instead.

![HTTP timing tooltip](images/http-performance.png)

### Adding and Editing Monitors

Configure the target URL or IP, check type, interval, tags, and which alert channels fire for this monitor. Tag autocomplete suggests existing labels as you type.

![Edit monitor form](images/edit-monitor.png)

### Alert Panel

The bell icon in the header shows a count of active outages. Click it to expand the panel, which separates ongoing outages from degraded monitors and shows a live elapsed-time counter for anything still down.

![Alerts panel](images/notifications.png)

### Notification Settings

Configure alert channels in Settings > Notifications. Each channel can be individually enabled or disabled, tested before saving, and assigned per-monitor in the edit form.

![Notification settings](images/notification-settings.png)

### Telegram Notifications

DOWN, RECOVERED, and DEGRADED events are sent immediately to your configured channels. No polling interval - alerts fire the moment the check result lands.

## Check Types

### HTTP / HTTPS

Sends a real HTTP or HTTPS request and measures the full request lifecycle.

**Best for:** public websites, REST APIs, reverse-proxied services, anything with a TLS certificate, third-party SaaS your app depends on.

**You get:** DNS ms, TCP ms, TLS ms, TTFB ms, HTTP status code, SSL expiry countdown.

### API

Sends an HTTP GET request and validates the response against configurable rules — status code, response body, or a specific JSON field value. Uses the same timing infrastructure as HTTP checks.

**Best for:** `/health` endpoints, JSON APIs where you care about the response payload not just reachability, services that return `200 OK` even when degraded.

**You get:** DNS ms, TCP ms, TLS ms, TTFB ms, HTTP status code, SSL expiry countdown, pass/fail for any configured body or JSON assertion.

**Auth options:** basic auth (username + password), bearer token, or custom headers (up to 5 key-value pairs).

> **Security note:** auth credentials are stored as plaintext in SQLite. Credential encryption is planned for a future release.

### TCP

Opens a raw TCP connection to a host and port. No application-layer data exchanged - success means the port accepted the connection.

**Best for:** databases (Postgres :5432, MySQL :3306, Redis :6379), mail servers, internal services not exposed via URL, verifying firewall rules and port-forwards.

**You get:** connection latency in ms.

### ICMP (Ping)

Sends an ICMP echo request. Measures raw round-trip latency with no concern for open ports or services.

**Best for:** bare-metal servers, network equipment (routers, switches, access points), NAS boxes, IoT devices, diagnosing latency vs availability.

> **Note:** ICMP requires the `NET_RAW` capability. The provided `docker-compose.yml` sets this automatically. Running outside Docker may require `sudo` or `CAP_NET_RAW` on the Node process.

**You get:** round-trip latency in ms.

---

## Getting Started

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Data is stored in a named volume (`watchtower-data`) and survives container restarts.

### Building and publishing a Docker image

To publish the image to Docker Hub for deployment on a remote host (e.g. TrueNAS, a home server):

```bash
docker build -t your-username/watchtower:latest .
docker push your-username/watchtower:latest
```

**Cross-platform builds (Apple Silicon → amd64)**

If you're building on an M-series Mac but deploying to an x86 machine, you need to target `linux/amd64` explicitly. Use `buildx`:

```bash
# One-time setup
docker buildx create --name multi --use

# Build for amd64 and push directly to the registry
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your-username/watchtower:latest --push .
```

To support both architectures (e.g. run locally on the Mac and deploy to x86):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t your-username/watchtower:latest --push .
```

> **Note:** `buildx` cross-compiled images can't be loaded into your local Docker daemon — `--push` sends them directly to the registry.

### Local development

```bash
# Terminal 1 - backend (Express on :3000)
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - frontend (Vite on :5173, proxies /api to :3000)
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

```bash
# Production build - outputs to server/public/, served by Express
npm run build
```

---

## Alert Notifications

Open the Settings panel (gear icon in the header) to configure channels. Test any channel before saving - credentials in the form are sent with the test request.

### Telegram (free)

1. Message `@BotFather` on Telegram and create a bot to get a token
2. Message your bot, then open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates` to find your chat ID
3. Paste the token and chat ID into the Telegram section and enable the channel

### Email (SMTP)

| Field    | Example                          |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| Host     | `smtp.gmail.com`                 |
| Port     | `587` (STARTTLS) or `465` (SSL)  |
| Username | your email address               |
| Password | App Password or account password |
| From     | the sending address              |
| To       | where alerts should land         |

Use the **Quick setup** buttons in the Notifications tab to auto-fill the host and port for Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or iCloud. A contextual note appears for any provider that requires an App Password.

Gmail, Yahoo, and iCloud users: use an App Password, not your account password. Outlook users with 2FA enabled also need an App Password.

### SMS via Twilio

Requires a Twilio account and a purchased phone number (~$0.008/message). Paste your Account SID, Auth Token, and both phone numbers in E.164 format (e.g. `+15551234567`).

---

## Embedding

Click the `<>` icon on any monitor card for a single-monitor widget, or click `<>` in the header for the full dashboard. Both tabs show a live URL preview and copyable iframe code.

![Embed modal](images/embed.png)

```html
<!-- Single monitor widget -->
<iframe
  src="https://your-watchtower/embed/monitor/MONITOR_ID"
  width="360" height="230" frameborder="0"
  style="border-radius:8px;overflow:hidden"
></iframe>

<!-- Full read-only dashboard -->
<iframe
  src="https://your-watchtower/embed"
  width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"
  style="border-radius:8px;overflow:hidden"
></iframe>
```

Embedded views receive live SSE updates and have no edit, delete, or settings controls.

---

## API Reference

WatchTower exposes two HTTP APIs:

- **Public API** (`/api/v1/`) — read-only, requires an API key. Use this to integrate with external tools, dashboards, or scripts.
- **Internal API** (`/api/`) — full CRUD, no key required. Intended for the dashboard UI on localhost. Restrict access at the network/proxy level if exposed.

---

### Authentication

The public API uses bearer token authentication. Generate a key in **Settings → General → API Keys**.

```
Authorization: Bearer wt_your_api_key_here
```

Keys are prefixed `wt_` and stored as SHA-256 hashes. The raw key is only shown once at creation.

#### Manage API keys

```
GET    /api/keys          List keys (returns prefix, not raw value)
POST   /api/keys          Create a new key
DELETE /api/keys/:id      Revoke a key
POST   /api/keys/:id/refresh   Rotate a key (issues a new raw value)
```

**Create a key**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Grafana integration" }'
```
```json
{
  "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "name": "Grafana integration",
  "key_prefix": "wt_abc123",
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00.000Z",
  "key": "wt_abc123defghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789"
}
```
> Save the `key` value — it is not stored and cannot be retrieved again.

---

## Roadmap

### Tag groups

Tags become first-class objects on the dashboard. The default view collapses each tag into a single summary card rather than showing every monitor individually.

- **Tag summary cards** - each tag renders as one card showing the tag name, the names of its members, an aggregate status (worst status wins - one DOWN member makes the group DOWN), member count, and a combined uptime figure
- **Expand on click** - clicking a tag card or its label replaces it in the grid with all the individual member cards; clicking again collapses them back
- **Untagged items** - monitors and modules with no tags always appear individually and are not grouped
